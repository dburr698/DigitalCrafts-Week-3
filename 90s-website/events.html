        <h3>Launch of the World Wide Web</h3>
        <img src="images/world-wide-web.jpg">
        <p>While this system of "interlinked hypertext documents" began 
            to be developed via the Internet in 1989, it wasn't until 
            1990 and 1991, when the project had its first test runs and 
            was fully publicized, that it changed the world as we know it.
            Thus the most important aspect of the 1990s was quietly ushered 
            in, leading to the creation of all things digital: Facebook, 
            Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram and other platforms that keep us 
            connected.</p>

        <h3>Los Angeles Riots</h3>
        <img src = "images/la-riots.jpg">
        <p>The Los Angeles riots sprung from years of rising tensions 
            between the LAPD and the cityâ€™s African Americans, highlighted 
            by the 1991 videotaped beating of motorist Rodney King. On April 
            29, 1992, anger boiled over after four LAPD officers were found 
            not guilty of assaulting King, leading to several days of 
            widespread violence, looting and arson throughout L.A. By May 3, 
            thousands of National Guardsmen and federal troops had largely 
            curbed the uprising, which left more than 60 people dead and 
            produced about $1 billion in damage.</p>
